# Setting Up

Let's get some HTML scaffold set up.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- you can ignore these -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

    <!-- imports, this you can ignore too -->
    <script type="module" src="https://component-host.maxwofford.repl.co/components.js"></script>

    <!-- this is the title you see inthe tab -->
    <title>NAME HERE</title>

    <!-- this changes how the page looks -->
    <style>
      
    </style>

  </head>

  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

Take not of these different sections but it's okay to copy the scaffold to get started.
